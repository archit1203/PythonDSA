LIST
    Dynamic sized Arrays
    can hold heterogeneous data
    l = [1,2,'key',7.9]
    Mutable
    -ve indexing is possible

    l = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    print(l)
    l=[1,2,3,'key',7.9]
    print(l)
    print(l[-1])

TUPLE
    Similar to lists
    Data cannot be changed inside it
    Data can be changed only if its Mutable
    When to use tuples?
        -> when our objects should not change
    
    tuple = (1,2,3,'key')
    print(tuple,type(tuple))

DICTIONARY
    Key value pairs
    Dictionary -> {key:value}
