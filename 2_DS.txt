What is DS?
    It is a way to store and organize data efficiently

Need of DS
    Data structures make it easy for users to access and 
    work with the data they need in appropriate ways. 
    Most importantly, data structures frame the organization 
    of information so that machines and humans can better understand it.

Linear & Non-Linear DS
    Way to store and organize data
    Linear  
        Array, LL, Stack, Queue, Hash
    Non-Linear  
        Tree, Graph

Arrays
    Linear DS
    Store mutliple data of same type
    In contiguous memory locations
    Cons:
        Fixed size
            Memory wastage
        Homogenous
            Lack of Flexibility , only one type of data
    
    Normal Arrays
        Arr = |1|2|3|4|5|

    Refrential Array
        |1|     |2|     |Hello|     |4|
        201     301     406         505

        Arr = |201|301|406|505|

        Can store hetrogeneuos type of data
        Slow speed
        Extra Memory

    (IMP) Dynamic Arrays
        Adjusts as per requirement
        Its a concept using ArraysPython Lists

        1->     |1|
        2->     |1|2|
        3->     |1|2|3| |
        4->     |1|2|3|4|
        5->     |1|2|3|4|5| | | |
